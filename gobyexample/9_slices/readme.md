# 🐹 Go Switch Statement Practice

A Go program demonstrating different uses of the `switch` statement, including value, time-based, and type-based switching.


# 🚀 Getting Started

This example helps understand:
- Basic value-based switch
- Using multiple values in a single `case`
- Switch without an expression (like `if`/`else`)
- Type switches for inspecting variable types


# 🔧 Topics Covered / Learnt

- Basic `switch` with `case` and `default`
- Grouping cases: `case A, B:`
- Using `time.Weekday()` and `time.Hour()` in switches
- `switch {}` as an alternative to chained `if-else`
- Type assertion with `switch t := i.(type)`
