# 🐹 Go If/Else Practice

A Go program demonstrating how to use conditional statements including `if`, `else if`, and `else`.


# 🚀 Getting Started

This example helps understand:
- Basic branching with `if` and `else`
- Conditions with logical operators (`&&`, `||`)
- Inline variable declaration within an `if` statement


# 🔧 Topics Covered / Learnt

- Checking even/odd using modulus (`%`)
- Using `if` without an `else`
- Combining conditions with logical operators
- Declaring variables inline inside `if` (e.g., `if num := 9; num < 0`)
- Writing multi-branch conditionals (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
