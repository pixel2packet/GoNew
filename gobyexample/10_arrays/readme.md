# 🐹 Go Arrays Practice

A Go program demonstrating how to declare, initialize, and use one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.


# 🚀 Getting Started

This example helps understand:
- How arrays work in Go
- How to initialize arrays in multiple ways
- Accessing, setting, and getting values by index
- Multi-dimensional arrays and nested loops


# 🔧 Topics Covered / Learnt

- Declaring fixed-length arrays: `var a [5]int`
- Setting values using index: `a[3] = 100`
- Getting values using index: `a[3]`
- Initializing arrays with values: `[5]int{...}`
- Using `...` to let Go count the length: `[...]int{...}`
- Indexed initialization: `[...]int{100, 3: 300, 400}`
- Checking array length with `len(...)`
- Creating and filling 2D arrays with nested loops
- Initializing 2D arrays with predefined values
