# 🐹 Go Constants Practice

A basic Go program demonstrating how to define and use **constants** with different data types and expressions.


# 🚀 Getting Started

This example covers:
- Defining constants with `const`
- Using untyped constants in expressions
- Performing arithmetic with constants
- Converting types (e.g., `float64` to `int64`)
- Using math functions with constants


# 🔧 Topics Covered / Learnt

- Declaring string and numeric constants
- Untyped vs typed constants
- Scientific notation (e.g., `2e11`)
- Division with constants
- Type conversion using `int64(...)`
- Using functions from the `math` package (like `math.Sin()`)
