# 🐹 Go `for` Loop Practice

A Go program demonstrating different ways to use the `for` loop, which is Go’s only looping construct.


# 🚀 Getting Started

This example covers:
- Traditional `for` loops with conditions and increment
- Using `range` in loops
- Infinite loops with `break`
- Loop control using `continue`


# 🔧 Topics Covered / Learnt

- `for` loop with a condition (`while`-like behavior)
- Classic loop: `for j := 0; j < 3; j++`
- Loop using `range <int>` (e.g., `range 3`)
- Infinite loop using `for { ... }` and exiting with `break`
- Skipping iterations with `continue`
- Using modulo (`%`) to filter even/odd numbers
