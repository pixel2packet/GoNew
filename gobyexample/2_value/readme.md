# 🐹 Go Values Practice

A simple Go program demonstrating the use of **basic value types and operations**:
- String concatenation
- Integer and float arithmetic
- Boolean logic and comparisons


# 🚀 Getting Started

This example helps understand how Go handles:
- Basic math operations with integers and floats
- Boolean expressions with `&&`, `||`, and `!`
- String manipulation using `+` operator


# 🔧 Topics Covered / Learnt

- String operations (`"go" + "lang"`)
- Integer addition (`1 + 1`)
- Float division (`7.0 / 3.0`)
- Boolean expressions:
  - AND (`&&`)
  - OR (`||`)
  - NOT (`!`)
- Combining logical expressions
